# MinAtar Dense Baseline
# Self-contained configuration for MinAtar Dense Baseline

defaults:
  - _self_

# Environment
env:
  id: "MinAtar/Breakout-v0" # Default, or can be overridden
  num_envs: 1
  capture_video: false
  frame_stack: 1 # MinAtar typically doesn't need much stacking if fully observable, but standard is often 4? MinAtar has channels for history? Actually MinAtar gives (N, N, C).
  # MinAtar already includes history in channels usually?
  # Checking minatar.yaml, it didn't specify frame_stack, so default 1.
